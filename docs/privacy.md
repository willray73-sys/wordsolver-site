# Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}  
**App:** WordSolve for 5-Letter Puzzles

## Summary
- WordSolve does not collect, store, or sell any personal data. No account or login is required. The app does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.
  
- The app connects to a remote service to retrieve word lists. These requests are not associated with any personal identifiers and are used solely to provide in-app functionality.

- If future versions introduce optional analytics or advertising features, this privacy policy will be updated to describe any new data use.

## Technical & Diagnostic Data
- **Apple and Google** may provide anonymized crash logs through TestFlight or the Play Store. These reports, when available, help improve app stability and contain no personally identifiable information.

- **WordSolve** makes network requests to fetch word lists and related metadata. These requests are not tied to user identity, and the app does not collect or store personal data in relation to them.

## Cookies & Tracking
- WordSolve does not use cookies or any form of third-party tracking.

## Children’s Privacy
This app is not directed to children under 13. As no personal data is collected, no child-specific information is stored or processed.

## Data Retention
WordSolve does not store personal data. Remote service logs (e.g., basic IP and request metadata) may be retained for standard server operations such as reliability, troubleshooting, and security, but these logs are not linked to any user identity.

## Your Rights
Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no user data to access or delete within the app. If you have questions, we are happy to help.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated over time. Any changes will appear here with a new effective date.
